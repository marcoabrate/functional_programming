  /**
   * One problem with the previous (failing) test is that JUnit will
   * only tell you that a test failed, but it will not tell you what was
   * the reason for the failure. The output looks like this:
   *
   * {{{
   *    [info] - one plus one is three? *** FAILED ***

   *
   * This situation can be improved by using a Assert.assertEquals
   * (this is only possible in JUnit). So if you
   * run the next test, JUnit will show the following output:
   *
   * {{{
   *    [info] - details why one plus one is not three *** FAILED ***
   *    [info]   2 did not equal 3 (ListsSuite.scala:67)
   * }}}
   *
   * We recommend to always use the Assert.assertEquals equality operator
   * when writing tests.

   *
   * In particular, write tests for corner cases: negative numbers, zeros,
   * empty lists, lists with repeated elements, etc.
   *
   * It is allowed to have multiple `assert` statements inside one test,
   * however it is recommended to write an individual `test` statement for
   * every tested aspect of a method.
